# Demo Suche f√ºr berlin/ demonstration search for berlin <https://demos-berlin.netlify.app/>

The Goal of this project was to give a neutral/unbiased App to search for Demonstrations in Berlin using the official Gouverment data. 

This was our second Projects during our Training to become a Full-Stack Developer which main focus was to excerice the implementation of API's in react.

## Introduction

During our search for an API to use for our Project i come across the fact that since 2021 the gouvernment of berlin has to publish data that are "public interest" in their [open data initivate](https://daten.berlin.de/)
After i found the Data about [demonstrations in berlin](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/versammlungen-im-land-berlin), i did a quick google search and couldnt find a Website that displays these data unbiased.
To my Knowledge only the political parties/organisations where presenting there topics.

Since i think in a Democracy it is important to make use of your right to demonstrate, we decided to make this our project.

## Goal

During our first brainstorm meeting is was clear very quickly that our main focus is gonna be a functional Webapp that display Data unbiased. therefore we didnt see the need to make it overly fancy and instead focus on simplicity.

## Features

The main feature is definitely the Searchbar which lets you search by date,location or topic.
Other than that we offer a calendar to have a quick overview.

In the Future we want to implement more features,as our Skill grow.
On the agenda is e.g. a Translation button to make the whole webapp available in english as well, since Berlin is such an international City.
